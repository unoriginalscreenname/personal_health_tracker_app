# Session Notes - Dec 27, 2025

## Summary

Enhanced the nutrition/food tracking UI with drill-down navigation and data management capabilities.

## What Was Done

### Food Timeline Drill-Down
- Made timeline entries clickable - tapping a time opens a detail screen for that meal entry
- New `entry/[id].tsx` screen shows all items in an entry with ability to add/remove items or delete entire entry
- Term clarification: these are called "detail screens" or "push views" in mobile dev

### Custom Food Entry Screen
- Replaced inline text input with a dedicated `custom-food.tsx` screen
- Form fields: Name, Protein (g), Calories, Description (optional)
- Description field intended for future AI-based macro estimation

### Nutrition Settings Screen
- Added settings icon (gear) to Fuel Tank header
- New `settings.tsx` screen lists all days with food entries
- Can view timeline for any day, delete individual entries, or delete all entries for a day
- "Reset all food data" button for development

### Database
- Added `getDaysWithEntries`, `deleteEntriesForDate`, `deleteAllEntries` functions
- Attempted to add `description` column but reverted due to migration issues
- Renamed "Vitamin D" supplement to "NAC"

### Deployment
- Built release APK and installed on physical Android phone via USB
- App runs standalone without Metro bundler

## Commits

- `252a742` - Update supplement name from 'Vitamin D' to 'NAC'
- `6f91488` - Add custom food navigation and UI enhancements
- `7199ce3` - Add settings and entry navigation to NutritionScreen

## Notes

- Database migrations are tricky - the description column was backed out to keep things working
- For future schema changes, consider resetting the database during development rather than complex migrations
