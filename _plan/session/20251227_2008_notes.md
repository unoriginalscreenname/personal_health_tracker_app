# Session Notes - Dec 27, 2025 (Evening)

## Summary

Fixed UI interaction bugs, added entry time editing, and improved Food Settings with tabbed navigation.

## What Was Done

### UI Interaction Fixes
- Water indicators: Each dot now individually clickable. Tapping fills up to that dot, tapping again unselects from that point
- Quick add foods: Clicking an added food now removes it (toggle behavior) instead of adding duplicates
- Food box navigation: Now switches to Fuel tab properly instead of pushing a modal-like view
- Entry detail X button: Removes food immediately without confirmation dialog

### Entry Time Editing
- Tapping the time in entry detail opens a custom time picker modal
- Hour/minute selectors with AM/PM toggle
- Added `updateEntryTime` function to database hooks
- Removed meal_type subtext from header (was showing "opener", "bridge", etc.)

### Food Settings Tabs
- Added tabbed interface: "Entries" and "Foods"
- Entries tab: existing day list with food entries
- Foods tab: lists all registered food items from database (seed data)
- Styled tabs with underline indicator and icons (fits app aesthetic)

### Hidden Features
- Meal grid (Opener/Bridge/Closer) hidden on Fuel page - marked with TODO to remove later

### Design Brief Updates
- Added "Component Patterns" section with specific examples
- Documented tab styling preference (underline, not filled backgrounds)
- Documented secondary action button pattern (dashed borders)

## Database Changes

- Added `updateEntryTime(entryId, newTime)` to useMealEntries hook

## Notes

- Database persists across app updates when using `adb install -r`
- Migrations run on app launch, not on install - version checked via `PRAGMA user_version`
- Build command should run in background to avoid terminal issues
